# TonicDNS cookbook

This cookbook is used to install [TonicDNS](https://github.com/Cysource/TonicDNS) - a RESTful API for [PowerDNS](https://www.powerdns.com/).

## Requirements
You should have already installed PowerDNS and pdns-backend-mysql to use it without errors.

Depends on cookbooks:

- apt
- apache2
- tar
- database
- [chef-pdns](https://github.com/podwhitehawk/chef-pdns) (this one used for tests)

## Supported Platforms
Tested and runs on:

- Ubuntu 12.04
- Ubuntu 14.04
- CentOS 6.5
- Debian 7.6

Should also work with other RHEL and Debian based distos, but not tested yet.

## Attributes

`node["TonicDNS"]["git_install"]` - whenever to install TonicDNS from remote or local source. Default - `true`

`node["TonicDNS"]["git_repo"]` - download URL for TonicDNS. Default - `https://github.com/Cysource/TonicDNS.git`

`node["TonicDNS"]["package_name"]` - name for local package located in files/default. Default - `tonicdns-git.tar.gz`

`node["TonicDNS"]["install_dir"]` - Docroot for apache2 where TonicDNS will be located. Default - `/var/www/TonicDNS`

`node["poweradmin"]["http_port"]` - port where TonicDNS API could be found. Default - `8080`

`node["tonicdns"]["user"]` - User that will be created to serve API requests. Default - `tonicdns`

`node["tonicdns"]["user_email"]` - email for user created to serve API requests. Default - `sampleuser@example.org`

Here is a block of mysql connection settings - it should be easy to understand what value stands for.

Should be the same, previously used to configure pdns-backend-mysql.

`node["tonicdns"]["hostname"]` = `'localhost'`

`node["tonicdns"]["username"]` = `'powerdns'`

`node["tonicdns"]["password"]` = `'p4ssw0rd'`

`node["tonicdns"]["dbname"]` = `'powerdns'`

## Usage

### tonicdns::default
Use `recipe[tonicdns::default]` to deploy TonicDNS API on your working copy of PowerDNS with mysql-backend.

### tonicdns::test
Use `recipe[tonicdns::test]` to deploy TonicDNS API alongside with test deployment of PowerDNS+mysql-backend used in this [chef-pdns](https://github.com/podwhitehawk/chef-pdns) test cookbook.

But it's not recomended to use it in such way. At least right now.
